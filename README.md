# Paraview Python Scripts
A few scripts from old (ca. 2014-2016) projects which automated visualization generation of results from [Casting Geometric Toolsuite](https://github.com/wwarriner/casting_geometric_toolsuite).
Probably outdated now, but could form the skeleton of new development for future projects.
